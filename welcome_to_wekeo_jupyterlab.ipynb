If you are reading this notebook from the JupyterLab, you will already have conducted a git clone to add this repository to the home directory in your Jupyter Lab. If you are reading this on GitHub, you need to open a terminal in the WEkEO JupyterLab, type << cd public >> followed by << bash wekeo-git-clone.sh https://github.com/wekeo/wekeo-jupyter-lab.git >> This will create a clone of this repository of notebooks in your home directory.

However, if you find that you need to alter the Python environment (adding new packages etc) for your own needs, you can do this using the terminal.

Combined with web-based platforms for hosting Git repositories, such as GitLab or GitHub, it is also a powerful way to share code and find code that you might need to do your work. The content that you see on the Jupyter Lab here is managed via a number of git repositories, developed by experts across the WEkEO partners and contractors, and hosted on the [WEkEO GitHub](https://github.com/WEkEO). \n",

    "Using Git based commands from the terminal in the WEkEO JupyterLab you can retrieve any updates made to the repository used here in future, commit any changes you make to a repository of your own, or bring in code from other repositories that may be useful. You will need to use the script descripted above (in the public folder) to clone in new repositories, and any repositories you wish to push back will need to be copied back to the tmp folder, as Git cannot be used directly from your personal home directory.

    "JupyterLab on WEkEO is a powerful environment for accessing and working with data, but everything has it's limitations. If you find yourself getting errors when running notebooks, a good first step is to restart the kernel and clear output - you can find this under the 'Kernel' drop down menu at the top of the notebooks. This will clear things in the memory space that's been used when you are running that notebook. You can also shut down any kernels and terminals you are not using (you can see these by clicking the ‘Running terminals and kernel’ tab on the left – its a square in a circle). You can see the memory currently in use in your JupyterLab, in the bottom left corner of the screen. You will also need to consider the amount of data queries you've made to the harmonised data access, as this data will also affect the amount of space you have to work in the interactive environment. In this case, delete data when you are done using it, and extract smaller subsets (in time and/or space and/or products). The notebooks and HDA access will work on WEkEO virtual machines, so if you really need to scale up your data use, check out the options WEkEO can provide.\n"
