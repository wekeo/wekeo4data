# wekeo-climetlab
 
**wekeo-climetlab** is a collection of Python-based code 
designed to provide an introduction and examples on the use 
of the CliMetLab WEkEO Plugins.

**PLEASE NOTE:** As of March 2025, the climetlab WEkEO Plugins have been superseeded by the [earthkit WEkEO plugins]('https://earthkit-data.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/wekeo.html'). The climetlab plugins and the notebooks are no longer maintained. Please check out the [wekeo-earthkit repository]('https://github.com/wekeo/wekeo4data/tree/main/wekeo-earthkit') to get started with WEkEO data using the [earthkit python package](https://github.com/ecmwf/earthkit).

## Getting Started
  
The course is based on [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which allow
a high-level of interactive learning, as code, text description and 
visualisation is combined in one place. If you have not worked with 
`Jupyter Notebooks` before, you can look at the module 
[Introduction to Python and Project Jupyter](./welcome_to_wekeo_jupyterlab.ipynb) 
to get a short introduction to the WEkEO Jupyter Lab workspace.

### Prerequisites
 
If you are working on a local machine, you will require Jupyter notebook to run this code. We recommend that you install the
latest Anaconda Python distribution for your operating system (https://www.anaconda.com/). 
Anaconda Python distributions include Jupyter Notebook. We recommend setting up an
environment as recommended below, however you may also adapt your current Python 
environment to include the dependencies listed.
